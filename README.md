## Solar Winds


## iOS Lock Screen

## GitHub Matrix

> The GitHub Matrix screensaver automatically downloads the most recent code commits from the open-source platform GitHub and displays the committed lines of code vertically in the style of the "digital rain" seen on computer screens in the movie The Matrix.

## FractalClock

> The white arms of a simple analogue clock show the current time against a black background in this Fractal Clock screensaver for Mac OS X. As time passes, fractals grow out of these arms, continuously weaving fresh elaborate patterns on your screen.


## Clock of Clocks

> This creative clock screensaver shows the current time in digital format using the hour and minute hands of a multitude of analog clocks placed together in a tight grid. The size of the grid changes every so often in order to show the time in a different style, and between showing the time each clock will turn its hands in a "dance" with the other clocks. The screensaver requires a macOS version upwards of 10.15 (Catalina).


## PongSaver

> Have the computer play a game of Pong against itself when you're away with the PongSaver screensaver for Mac OS X. The time is displayed in a gray font at the top of the screen, and two white paddles move up and down along the left and right edges of the screen, trying to prevent the "ball" from escaping around them and reaching the edge of the screen. Sounds are enabled by default but can optionally be disabled, you can choose between either a 12 or a 24 hour clock, and the screensaver can be displayed on multiple monitors.

## Time-Saver

> This clock screensaver from British communications firm To The Point displays the current time on your screen in one of three different modes: "dot time", "analog time" or "world time". When "world time" is selected, three analog clocks are shown, one for every timezone, which by default are set to London, New York and Dubai, but you can customize these to your preference (the time difference is not automatically set).
